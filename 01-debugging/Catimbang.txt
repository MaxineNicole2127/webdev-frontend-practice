Personally, I prefer using the forward analysis or "print statement" debugging technique. It's my go-to because it allows me to track the flow of my code and inspect variables at different stages. I find it super helpful in understanding how my code is executing and identifying any potential issues along the way. Plus, it's straightforward and doesn't require any additional tools or software. Just sprinkle some print statements where I suspect problems might exist, run the code, and I can see the values of variables or where the code might be going wrong. It's a method that's been reliable and effective for me in resolving bugs efficiently.git
